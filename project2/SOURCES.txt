CSCI 610 Final Project

This project does not have any special features, only a static image is produced.

This project uses 4 object files which are from the RIT CSCI 610 directory found below:
Cone: https://www.cs.rit.edu/~cscix10/pub/meshes/Cone20.h
Cube: https://www.cs.rit.edu/~cscix10/pub/meshes/Cube20.h
Sphere: https://www.cs.rit.edu/~cscix10/pub/meshes/Sphere20.h
Cylinder: https://www.cs.rit.edu/~cscix10/pub/meshes/Cylinder20.h

Additionally, 2 FREE use images are used for textures which are linked below:
Barn Wall: https://hipwallpaper.com/view/MGCUqD
Silo Wall: https://pixabay.com/photos/wall-plant-vines-cement-concrete-613010/

The final image is created with 15 shapes.
Shapes Overview:

GROUND - created with a cube and uses phong shading
SILO - created with a cylinder and uses texture shading
SILO_CAP - created with a sphere and uses phong shading
ROUND_BARN - created with a cylinder and uses texture shading
ROUND_BARN_ROOF - created with a cone and uses flat shading
MINI_BARN - created with a cube and uses flat shading
MINI_BARN_ROOF - created with a cone and uses flat shading
SIDE_BARN - created with a cone and uses flat shading
SIDE_BARN_ROOF - created with a cube and uses phong shading
BACK_BARN - created with a cube and uses flat shading
BACK_BARN_ROOF - created with a cone and uses flat shading
WINDOW_BARN - created with a cube and uses flat shading
WINDOW_BARN_ROOF - created with a cone and uses flat shading
ROUND_BARN_WINDOW - created with a cube and uses flat shading
MINI_BARN_WINDOW - created with a cube and uses flat shading
